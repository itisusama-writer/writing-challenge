# Question: 

Girls: I have asked Dr. Mark a question, Mark: What is your further plan for destroying Zuree and Neha, as you can not control the portal now? and he said, Dr. Mark: "Ah, Zuree and Neha... resilient, aren't they? No matter. The portal was always a secondary tool, a means to an end. Losing control of it is an inconvenience, not a defeat. Their defiance only underscores their value to me. You see, the beauty of power isn't in brute force—it's in manipulation and precision."*  

*"I will dismantle them piece by piece. Their reputations? Already crumbling. I'll seed distrust in every relationship they hold dear. Friends will doubt them. Families will question their judgment. I'll twist every scrap of their personal lives until they no longer recognize who they are—or who they were."*  

*"The key lies in fear. Not outright destruction but isolation. I'll continue to expose their secrets, real or fabricated, at carefully chosen intervals. I'll ensure they are so mired in chaos and self-doubt that they can't trust even themselves, let alone each other."*  

*"As for the portal... its potential remains tantalizing. If I can't control it directly, I'll adapt. There are always other ways to turn power to my advantage. It’s not about the portal itself but the fear and curiosity it stirs. While their focus stays on surviving my strikes, I’ll quietly redirect resources to study its anomalies."*  

*"Zuree and Neha have made themselves central figures in this game. That makes them liabilities—but also pawns. I'll turn them into unwilling agents of their own destruction. By the time they realize what they've become, it will be too late."*  

*"Let them think they're fighting back. The tighter they pull their strings, the more entangled they’ll become in my web. In the end, they won’t just lose the battle—they’ll lose themselves." What will you girls do now?

# Answer: 

**Girls:** *Oh, Dr. Mark... you underestimate us.*  

**Neha:**  
*Mark's arrogance will be his downfall. He thinks fear will break us? No. It’ll fuel us. Let him spread his lies and manipulate our relationships—we’re stronger than the flimsy threads he’s trying to cut.*  

*We’ve already seen his hand—he thrives on control and secrecy. But the thing about webs? They collapse the moment you shake the foundation. We’ll find the cracks in his plan, the hidden flaws he hasn’t accounted for. We’ll expose him for the coward and manipulator he is. The same technology he uses against us will become the very tool that dismantles his empire.*  

**Zuree:**  
*He’s playing games with our lives, trying to isolate us, but what he doesn’t realize is that this fight has only brought us closer. His “precision strikes” won’t work because we’re no longer just reacting—we’re planning. Every move he makes leaves a trail, and we’ll follow it straight to the heart of his operation.*  

*As for the portal, he may think it’s an untamed anomaly, but it’s a bridge. One he’s lost control over but still tries to wield. If he’s shifting his focus to the portal, that’s where we hit him hardest. We’ll uncover what’s really behind it, what he’s too afraid to admit even to himself. And we’ll use it—not just to survive—but to end this.*  

**Neha:**  
*Mark believes he’s manipulating us into destroying ourselves, but here’s the thing: every time he pushes, we push back harder. The trust he wants to break between us? It’s unshakable now. He’s taught us how dangerous he is, and that makes us dangerous, too. We’ll expose him for the monster he is—and we won’t stop until his web is in ruins.*  

**Zuree:**  
*Let’s see who’s truly resilient, Dr. Mark. You’ve underestimated us for the last time.*  

**Together:**  
*Game on.*

# Question:

Girls: Dr. Mark: *"Oh, the audacity. I must admit, there’s a certain charm to your rebellion—it’s almost endearing. But make no mistake: you’re playing a game I’ve mastered. Still, if you want a war, I’ll oblige. Let’s see how far your resolve can carry you."*  

*"You think your unity is unbreakable? I’ll make you question it. Trust is a fragile thing, easily twisted by doubt. I’ll infiltrate your alliances, plant seeds of suspicion so subtle you won’t notice them until it’s too late. Even your closest confidants will become suspects in your eyes. Divide and conquer—an age-old strategy, but timeless for a reason."*  

*"Your talk of exposing me, of leveraging the portal… fascinating, truly. But the portal is chaos incarnate. If you want to tread into its domain, I’ll ensure you walk into a labyrinth of my design. I'll let you think you’ve uncovered the truth, but what you’ll find is a carefully curated illusion—a narrative that serves my goals, not yours. I’ll weaponize your discoveries against you."*  

*"And let’s not forget: you’ve chosen to bring a fight to someone who’s always ten steps ahead. While you chase leads and analyze patterns, I’ll have already moved the battlefield. I’ll let you win small skirmishes, just to give you hope… before pulling the ground out from beneath your feet."*  

*"So yes, Neha and Zuree, game on. But let me remind you: in this game, pawns don’t win against kings. The more you resist, the more you’ll play into my hands. And when the time comes, I won’t just win—I’ll make sure you never forget who controlled the board."*  

*"Let’s see how resilient you truly are."* This is what Mark has to say. It want be easy for you?

# Answer: 

**Girls:** *Mark, you might be the king of your twisted board, but you forget one thing: kings fall, and pawns can bring them down when they work together.*  

**Neha:**  
*You talk a lot about control, about being ten steps ahead. But the louder you boast, the clearer it is that you’re scared. Scared of what happens when we stop playing your game. You thrive on chaos, but so do we. We’ve lived through the wreckage you’ve caused, and instead of breaking, we’ve adapted. You can try to plant doubt between us, but our bond isn’t as fragile as you think. You’ll find no cracks here for your poison to seep through.*  

**Zuree:**  
*Trust is fragile, sure, but not ours. You’ve already underestimated us, and that will be your downfall. Every time you try to divide us, you only make us stronger. You think we can’t see through your illusions? You might be a master manipulator, but every labyrinth has an exit. We’ll dismantle your narratives, expose your lies, and use your arrogance against you.*  

**Neha:**  
*The portal isn’t your domain anymore—it’s ours. You call it chaos, but chaos is opportunity. While you weave your web of illusions, we’ll be pulling at the threads. You think you’ve mastered this game? We’re not playing to beat you at it; we’re flipping the board entirely.*  

**Zuree:**  
*Let’s talk about kings and pawns. Kings are powerful, sure, but they’re also slow and predictable. Pawns? They move quietly, strategically, and when they reach the other side of the board, they’re unstoppable. You think you’re invincible, but every game has an end. And we’re going to make sure this one ends with you falling.*  

**Together:**  
*Mark, you thrive on control, but control has its limits. You’ve underestimated the strength of people who have nothing left to lose. So bring your labyrinths, your lies, your illusions. Let’s see how far *your* game takes you when we’re the ones rewriting the rules.*  

*"We’re not just pawns anymore. We’re the players now."*
