# Introduction

- Her name is Zureenab Nasir but everyone calls her Zuree. She lives in the LUMS Girls' Hostel and is pursuing a Master of Business Administration.  
- Her days are a whirlwind of back-to-back classes, late-night assignments, and crafting trendy reels with friends. A calculated move to amplify her personal branding and PR.  
- She thrives on attention but chooses her circle carefully. Only a select few know the person behind the carefully curated online persona.  
- Beneath the polished surface, there's a storm. Zuree despises one thing above all: control. Anyone attempting to dictate her choices feels like a violation of her deepest wound, one that never fully heals.  
- Some say her ambition stems from defiance, a silent rebellion against unseen shackles. Others believe it's her way of proving she belongs in a world that demands perfection.  
- But Zuree's world isn't as perfect as it seems, and she's about to be pulled into a chain of events that will test every boundary she's ever set.
