# Introduction

The sunlight streamed through the cream-colored curtains of Zuree's hostel room, the faint hum of campus life filtering through her slightly cracked window. The muted buzz of early morning chatter mixed with the occasional bicycle bell echoed in the courtyard below. Zuree sat up, her hands instinctively brushing through her disheveled hair. The desk by her bed was a chaotic tableau: stacks of books, mismatched coffee mugs, and her ever-glowing ring light. a silent testament to the duality of her existence.  

She grabbed her phone from the nightstand. Notifications flooded the screen: likes, comments, and shares. One in particular caught her eye, a comment on her latest reel that read, *"Your life is like a movie! So inspiring!"* A smirk curled her lips. They didn't know, of course, that the "movie" was scripted.  

Her thumb hovered over the notification bar as a pang of unease rippled through her chest. She dismissed the feeling with a practiced shrug and slid out of bed.  

Zuree rushed down the hostel hallway, her steps quick yet calculated. Her sleek black backpack bobbed behind her as she narrowly avoided a groggy student dragging their feet toward the showers.  

"Hey, Zuree!" a voice called out.  

She turned to see a cluster of her friends leaning against the stairwell railing.  

"Look at this," Alisha teased, holding up her phone. On the screen was Zuree's latest post, racking up views faster than a wildfire.  

"Already viral before breakfast?" Eshaal chimed in with a grin.  

"Must be nice to live in your world," someone muttered, half-joking.  

Zuree laughed, brushing off the comment. "You guys know me... same old Zuree, just with a little sparkle."

Inside, the weight of their expectations pressed against her chest. She quickened her pace, eager to escape their critical observations.  

Escaping from ther prying eyes Zuree walked in her element debating in a marketing lecture. She started the debate righ aways exchanging sharp insights with classmates. Her ambition and determination are evident.

Her day was not over yet, there were so many many classes she had to go through and between her classes, she mostly slips away for a moment to film a quick reel with her friends, masking exhaustion with a radiant smile.    

Zuree's classes were over but her friends had to take few more extra classes, as though she decided to step in the library to wait for them, or to film some more solo content.

The library was dimly lit, its usual buzz replaced with a calm stillness. Zuree sat by a corner window, flipping through the pages of a marketing textbook. Her pen twirled absently between her fingers, but her thoughts were elsewhere.  

Her phone buzzed, breaking the silence. A text from her mother popped up: *‚ÄúWhat are you planning after graduation? We need to talk soon.‚Äù*  

Zuree stared at the screen, her jaw tightening. Her chest swelled with the familiar frustration she had long learned to bury. The question wasn‚Äôt new, nor was her aversion to answering it. She tossed the phone aside and leaned back in her chair, staring out at the sprawling campus lawn.  

A few moments later, her hand reached for her phone again, this time opening her camera app. With the window as a backdrop, she tilted her head slightly, letting a soft smile play on her lips. She snapped a picture and posted it with a caption: *‚ÄúStudy grind never stops üí™‚ú®.‚Äù*  

In the evening she sits in the hostel lounge. She shares light-hearted banter with her close curated circle of friends Eshaal Ahmad, Alisha Hameed and Aiman Afaq which she choose with care, and for her own benifits in futere. Aiman joke about how Zuree's life is ‚Äútoo perfect‚Äù to be real.
  
Zuree deflects with a laugh, but her inner dialogue reveals cracks in the facade... a fear of losing control over the life and reputation she's built.

The hostel grew quiet as the night deepened. Zuree sat on the narrow ledge of her window, her knees pulled up to her chest. The city lights flickered in the distance, a mosaic of moving cars and streetlights.  

She exhaled slowly, her breath fogging up the glass. Her reflection stared back at her, and for a fleeting second, she caught a glimpse of herself, untouched by filters, stripped of the masks she so carefully wore.  

Her thoughts swirled, the threads of her life tangled in a web she wasn‚Äôt sure she could maintain much longer. The charity event loomed ahead, an innocuous gathering that she thought would be just another stepping stone.  

But something about the quiet stillness of this night whispered otherwise.
