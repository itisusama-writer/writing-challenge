# Supposed Solution

After receiving the blackmail messages, It feel like she's trapped in a nightmare that she can't wake up from. It's this suffocating mix of fear, confusion, and anger. Every time she see one of those coded senders pop up on her phone, her stomach drops, and her heart races.  

Zuree feels like exposed, like someone has stripped away all her defenses and is watching her every move. It's not just about the messages anymore. It's about the power they hold over her. They know things about her that she thought were hers to keep, and now it was like they can twist those things against her whenever they want.  

She spent hours going over the messages, trying to find a pattern or a clue. Every time Zuree think she spotted something, it just leads to more questions. Desperate for answers but terrified of what she might find.  

Crying has become a routine for her, but it doesn't help. It's like she was carrying this invisible weight that no one else can see, and it's pulling her down further every day. She can't trust anyone fully... not even Alisha and Eshaal. What if the person doing this is someone close?  

And yet, there's a small, stubborn part of her that doesn't want to let them win. It's buried under all the fear, but it's there, whispering that *Zuree you need to fight back*. She just don't know how yet.

Zuree racked her brain, trying to figure out who could be behind this, but no one stands out clearly. That's part of what makes this so terrifying.

At first, Zuree wondered if it could be her ex. He's the only person who would have had that photo, and they didn't exactly end on good terms. But... he's not the type to pull something like this. At least, Zuree don't think he is. And if he was involved, why would he be hiding behind these weird coded messages?

Then She thought about someone from campus, maybe someone she don't know well. But how would they get access to that photo? Unless it's someone who's been watching her for a while. Someone who somehow hacked into her phone or her data. The thought makes her skin crawl.

Dr. Mark and Tahir Khadim also cross her mind. The timing with the charity event and the biometric scanner feels too coincidental. But what motive would they have? They seem so focused on their tech; She can't imagine them stooping to this. Still, that faint unease Zuree felt during the scan...  it hasn't gone away.

Right now, it feels like everyone is a suspect, and that's the scariest part. Whoever is doing this knows her. Knows things they shouldn't, and she don't even know where to start looking for them.

It's all about the betrayal. The exposure is humiliating, and the consequences are terrifying, but knowing someone violated Zuree's trust... that they had access to parts of her, that she thought were safe, is what truly keeps her up at night. That photo was something private, something she never thought anyone would weaponize. It's like a knife in her back, and the worst part is she din't even know who's holding it.

She can't shake the feeling charity event. The timing is just too perfect.. or too awful, depending on how you look at it. The charity event was supposed to be this big, innovative thing, and then this happens right after? That biometric scanner was collecting everyone's data, and the unease she felt during the scan... it's still there. It's like her gut is screaming at her that something wasn't right. Maybe someone used that event to get to Zuree, but she can't figure out how or why.

It feels like she's piecing together a puzzle without all the pieces, and the picture she's seeing is starting to scare her.

Zuree replayed the charity event in her mind for the hundredth time, trying to recall if she noticed anything unusual. The scanner had stood out to her, not just because it was new technology, but because of the way it had made her feel. The demonstration was flawless, almost too perfect. She remembered how Tahir Khadim had explained its features to be secure, innovative, infallible. But the faint unease had started the moment her data was captured. She couldn't explain it at the time, but now it gnawed at her.

She thought back to the man who had been standing next to the scanner, the one whose face she couldn't quite place. He wasn't part of the team that had been introduced. He wasn't mingling like the other guests either. Had he been watching her? Or was her paranoia twisting every memory into something sinister?

The messages were no less haunting. Zuree had gone through them so many times she could recite them word for word. The sender IDs were random strings of numbers and letters, almost like they were generated by a machine. But one thing stood out... each message had been sent at a specific time: 11:11 PM. She hadn't noticed it at first, too caught up in the horror of their content, but now it seemed deliberate. Was it a signature? A taunt? 

The messages also referenced details that no one else should know. Private moments, conversations, and feelings Zuree hadn't shared with anyone. It made her feel exposed, like every corner of her life was under a microscope. But when she tried to piece together how they could know these things, she hit a wall. Her phone? Her laptop? Something in her home? The possibilities were endless, and each one was more terrifying than the last.

Seeking help crossed her mind, but trust was a luxury she couldn't afford. Alisha and Eshaal were her closest friends, and she wanted to believe in them, but doubt had crept in. If the person behind this was someone close, confiding in them could make things worse. Besides, what could they do? This was bigger than them, bigger than her. 

She had considered going to the authorities, but what would she even say? That someone was sending her cryptic messages and she had no idea who or why? She didn't have proof, just a gut feeling that this was more than it seemed. Without tangible evidence, she feared they'd dismiss her as paranoid.

And yet, that stubborn part of her... the part that refused to let this person win was growing louder. If she couldn't trust anyone, she'd figure this out herself. Zuree decided to start small, revisiting the charity event. She'd look into the attendees, cross-reference them with the times and dates of the messages. She'd scour every photo, every video from that night, searching for something... anything... that felt out of place.

She also decided to inspect her devices. Maybe there was a clue there, a piece of spyware or a strange log entry she'd overlooked. It wasn't much, but it was a start. The thought of taking action, however small, gave her a flicker of hope. 

For the first time in weeks, Zuree felt a shift. The fear was still there, sharp and suffocating, but so was the fight. Whoever was doing this thought they could control her, that they could trap her in their game. But Zuree wasn't going to play by their rules anymore.
