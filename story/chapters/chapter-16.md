# The Masked Benefactor

In a dimly lit room cluttered with empty snack wrappers, a young boy sat at his desk, intently focused on his laptop. His fingers flew over the keyboard as he navigated through various lines of code, his eyes darting between the screen and the notes strewn across his desk. He munched on chips, the sound of crunching almost drowned out by the steady rhythm of his typing.

The boy’s room was small, tucked away from prying eyes, and he kept to himself. His identity was a mystery, his online presence cloaked in anonymity. Only a handful of people knew of his existence, and none knew what he was capable of. Yet, he was the one who’d been watching the conflict unfold between Neha, Zuree, and Dr. Mark. 

His task tonight was simple: manipulate Dr. Mark’s AI system. The one that had been tracking Neha and Zuree, using their personal data to torment them and some other innocents. It was time for a change. The boy had already compromised several security systems, but tonight, he was going to do something different... inject a small error, a piece of false data, and watch Dr. Mark’s AI slowly begin to corrupt itself.

His fingers paused for a moment, and then, with a final keystroke, he activated the program. The system was in motion. He leaned back in his chair, chewing on another handful of snacks, his lips curling into a satisfied smirk.  

The boy’s laptop screen flickered briefly, signaling the success of his work. On the screen, lines of code ran rapidly, but it wasn’t just any code. It was a detailed program running Dr. Mark’s AI system. Complex, organized, and highly efficient. However, through the boy’s careful injections, subtle discrepancies began to appear.

His fingers worked again, inserting layers of falsified information, designed to confuse the AI, to make it less reliable. The truth of its surveillance would begin to warp. The boy paused to glance at the stream of information before him, watching it twist into an unintelligible mess.

The AI would no longer be able to distinguish between real data and the falsified input, leading Dr. Mark's systems into an uncharted, unstable territory. It was a slow process—one that would take days or weeks to completely unfold—but for the boy, this was just the beginning.

He closed the laptop and leaned back again, the first signs of a grin spreading across his face. The game had only just begun, and now he was in control.

The sun had barely risen over the LUMS campus, casting a soft light through the trees. Neha and Zuree sat on a bench near the library, trying to shake off the tension that had lingered in the days following their pact. They had spent the last few days moving cautiously, unsure of who to trust, and the quiet after the storm had begun to feel more unsettling than peaceful.

Zuree, her phone in hand, checked her messages with a mix of expectation and dread. She froze as she saw a new one, different from the usual warnings and threats they’d been receiving.  

The message read:  
*This is not a threat. It’s a warning. Dr. Mark has been watching you, and the danger is far from over. I’ve found a way to stop him, but I need your trust. Follow the instructions carefully. The system is unstable, and soon, it will break. You must act before it’s too late*

Zuree looked at Neha, her brows furrowed in confusion. “This is... different,” she said softly. “Is this from Dr. Mark?”  

Neha shook her head, her mind racing. “I don’t know. But something feels off. What if it’s another trap?”  

Zuree hesitated but then typed a quick response, just to see if the sender would reply.  

Moments later, another message arrived, this one different from the usual. The number was masked, but the message itself was clear:

*“You need to trust me. You don’t need to know who I am. But go with what the AI messages say. I am here to help. I am really close to breaking his system.”*

Neha’s breath hitched. She stared at the screen, her heart pounding in her chest. “This... this doesn’t make sense,” she whispered. “Is this real? Who’s sending this?”  

Zuree’s grip tightened around her phone. “It’s not the same sender... I think he or she is telling the truth.” She paused, looking up at Neha. “We’ve got to do something. We can’t keep sitting here and waiting for Dr. Mark to destroy everything.”  

Neha stood up, her voice determined despite her confusion. “We have to act, Zuree. But how do we know we can trust this person?”  

Zuree stared at the message one more time, and then at Neha. “I don’t know. But right now, I think it’s our best shot.”  

Together, they decided to follow the instructions... unsure of what awaited them, but ready to take their next step.

Later they walked in the lecture hall. It was eerily quiet as the students filtered in, preparing for the day’s class. Zuree and Neha sat at the back, still unsure of what to make of the strange messages they had received. The weight of the situation sat heavily between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts as the minutes ticked by.

Zuree’s phone buzzed again. She looked down at the screen, her heart skipping a beat. The message was from the same anonymous number:

*“I need you to trust the system. Follow its commands. Do nothing logical. Confuse the AI. The more you act unpredictably, the closer we are to breaking it. Don’t question it. Just do what you’re told.”*

Neha glanced over at Zuree, confusion and concern in her eyes. “What does this even mean?” she whispered. “Confuse the AI? Isn’t that just going to make things worse?”  

Zuree shook her head, her brow furrowed in frustration. “I don’t know. But there’s something about this message... it doesn’t feel like the usual threats. It almost feels like... like the AI is helping us.”

Neha leaned closer. “So, we’re supposed to act erratically? Is this a trick? Are we really supposed to follow these instructions?”  

Zuree took a deep breath. “We don’t have many options. Dr. Mark and his system are still watching us. What if... what if this is our only chance to finally break free of it?”  

Neha hesitated but then nodded. “Alright. We do what it says. But this feels... wrong.”  

They both stood up, their minds swirling with uncertainty. They knew that every action, every step from here on out, could be the one that tipped the balance, either bringing them closer to freedom or pulling them into an even deeper trap. But they were determined. The AI system was supposed to be all-knowing, all-seeing, but if they could throw it off balance, maybe, just maybe, they could beat it.

In the dimly lit office, Dr. Mark sat hunched over his desk, his eyes glued to the multiple monitors in front of him. The faint hum of the AI system filled the room, its usual efficiency now replaced by a chaotic mess of disorganized data. Lines of code and strange patterns flashed across the screens, all erratic, seemingly disconnected from any logical source.

His fingers hovered over the keyboard, trying to input commands to regain control, but nothing was working. The AI was disobeying him. It was like it had a mind of its own, and the more he tried to stabilize it, the more it slipped from his grasp.

“What is happening?” he muttered to himself, his voice tinged with frustration. “This should not be possible.”

The screens flickered again, showing a set of instructions: *“Confuse. Mislead. Do not correct. Let it break.”*

Dr. Mark’s jaw clenched as he ran his hands through his hair. He had worked tirelessly for years to perfect this system, this AI that was supposed to give him control over everything, including the very people who had defied him. But now, it was out of his hands, slipping through his fingers like sand.

He slammed his fist onto the desk. “No... no, no, no!” He was so close to having it all under his control, and now the AI was falling apart. 

He glanced at the message that kept repeating across the screens—confusion, misinformation, and orders that would only lead to more errors. It was a deliberate sabotage, one that he couldn’t undo.

Tahir stood at the doorway, watching Dr. Mark with quiet concern. “What’s going on? Why is the system failing?” he asked, his voice steady but tinged with curiosity.

Dr. Mark looked up, his face pale with frustration. “I can’t stop it. It’s breaking itself down. There’s someone... someone interfering with it. It’s like the system is sabotaging itself.”

Tahir raised an eyebrow. “Is it a hacker?”

“I don’t know,” Dr. Mark said, his voice low. “But whoever it is, they’re clever. Too clever. And they’re winning.”  

Tahir stepped into the room, his expression cold. “Then we need to act. We can’t let them take everything from us.”  

Dr. Mark nodded, the lines of worry deepening on his face. “I know. But we need a plan. If we don’t regain control soon...” He trailed off, his voice full of growing dread.  

The AI was no longer under his command. The more he fought it, the more it pushed back, like a sentient force bent on its own destruction. Dr. Mark’s grip tightened around his chair, his eyes narrowing in determination.

“We’re not done yet. This is just another obstacle. I will make sure of it.”
