# The Pursuit

The group huddled in the dimly lit backroom of an abandoned warehouse a few miles away from the chaos they had escaped. Arham kept a protective arm around Neha as she leaned against him, still regaining her strength. Zuree sat close by, her eyes darting nervously toward the group of girls who had emerged from the portal.  

Among them, Jaisa stood apart, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. Her elder sister, Tabeenah, was by her side, whispering soothing words. The girls were confused, trembling, and visibly shaken.  

“Who are they?” Zuree whispered, breaking the heavy silence.  

Jaisa glanced up, her eyes weary but sharp. “We were trapped,” she said quietly. “In that... place. For so long.”  

“What place?” Zuree pressed.  

Tabeenah placed a hand on Jaisa’s shoulder, speaking for her. “It’s hard to explain. A place between worlds. The portal brought us back.”  

Neha sat up straighter, her voice hoarse. “Can you help us get these girls to safety?”  

Jaisa nodded. “We’ll guide them. Some need to go home. Some need to go back to UOL hostel. But we can’t linger here. It could be dangerous.”

Back at the site of the portal, Dr. Mark surveyed the wreckage with a simmering rage. His guards stood silently, awaiting orders as the faint hum of the still-active portal pulsed in the background.  

Tahir Khadim, his right hand with a calculating gaze, stepped forward. “We underestimated them,” he said flatly.  

Dr. Mark didn’t reply immediately, his attention fixed on the swirling colors of the portal. “This changes everything,” he finally said. “The portal wasn’t just a tool. It’s a gateway to something much greater.”  

Tahir frowned. “You’re thinking of harnessing it? It’s unstable.”  

Dr. Mark turned sharply, his expression dark. “Of course it’s unstable. But that instability is power. Imagine what we could achieve if we controlled it.”  

“You are an engineer, not a black magic person... and what about the escapees?” Tahir asked.  

“They won’t get far,” Dr. Mark said coldly. “Send the trackers. Bring them back... alive if possible. But if they resist...” His voice trailed off, his meaning clear.

Jaisa and Tabeenah gathered the girls into smaller groups, whispering plans for safe routes back to their homes and hostels.  

“We’ll split up,” Tabeenah said firmly. “It’s the only way to we could be safe from that whoever person from finding us all.”  

Zuree frowned, her voice uneasy. “What about Neha and me? Dr. Mark won’t stop coming for us.”  

Arham’s gaze hardened. “We’ll keep moving. But first, we help them.”  

Neha looked at him, her eyes filled with a mix of gratitude and lingering disbelief. “Arham... how are you here?”  

“Later,” he said gently, brushing her cheek. “For now, focus on what’s ahead.”  

As the groups began to scatter into the night, Zuree and Neha stayed close to Arham. Jaisa and Tabeenah led a smaller group toward the outskirts of the city, their steps quick and deliberate.  

But as they crossed a narrow alleyway, a flash of movement caught Arham’s attention. He raised a hand, signaling for silence.  

Too late. The first shot rang out, shattering the fragile quiet.  

“Run!” Arham yelled, pulling Neha to cover as more gunfire erupted.  

Tahir Khadim emerged from the darkness, flanked by armed guards. His face was calm, his movements precise. “You can’t escape,” he called out. “Not from us. Not from what’s coming.”  

Zuree’s heart raced as she ducked behind a crumbling wall, clutching her phone like a lifeline.  

Arham stepped forward, shielding Neha and Zuree. “Keep going,” he urged. “I’ll hold them off.”  

“No!” Neha cried, grabbing his arm. “We don’t leave you behind.”  

“You have to,” Arham insisted, his voice firm. “Get the girls to safety. I’ll find you.”  

Tabeenah looked at Arham before stepping forward. “I’ll help,” she said, her voice steady despite the fear in her eyes.  

“I know how to handle this situation. They can’t be allowed to win.”  

Reluctantly, Neha and Zuree joined the retreating group of girls, their hearts heavy as they left Arham and the Tabeenahh to face Tahir and Dr. Mark’s forces.  

Dr. Mark watched the chaos from a safe distance, his lips curling into a cold smile. “They’ll come to us eventually,” he said to Tahir. “The portal ensures it.”  

Tahir nodded. “And when they do?”  

Dr. Mark’s smile widened. “We’ll be ready.”  

As the night wore on, the battle between the fugitives and their pursuers raged on, setting the stage for a confrontation that would decide far more than their fates.
