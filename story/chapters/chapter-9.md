# The Trap Tightens

The tension in the air was suffocating as Zuree and Neha huddled in Zuree's room. Neha paced back and forth, the glow of her cigarette cutting through the dim light while Zuree stared at her laptop, hesitant to touch it.  

Neha glanced at Zuree's laptop. "If they're tracking you through your devices, we need to check your accounts. I'll guide you through it."  

Zuree's hands shook as she opened her email. Neha leaned over her shoulder, pointing at the security settings. "Change your password first," she instructed.  

As Zuree typed, a new email popped into her inbox. The subject line read: *"You Can't Hide."*  

Zuree's heart stopped. She clicked on it despite Neha's protests. The message contained an attachment labeled *Scanner_Patterns.pdf* and a single line of text:  

*"You gave us everything. Now, watch it all unravel."*  

Neha grabbed the laptop, her eyes scanning the email. "Don't open that file. It could be malware."  

"But what if it's a clue?" Zuree countered, her voice breaking.  

Neha hesitated, then sighed. "Fine. We'll open it on my old laptop. If it's a trap, it won't compromise anything important."  

They transferred the file and opened it on Neha's device. The document was a list of data points, handprints, scans, and behavioral patterns, all tied to Zuree's name.  

Neha's jaw clenched. "This is more than personal. They're building a profile on you."  

Zuree's voice quivered. "Why? What do they want from me?"  

Neha didn't answer. She closed the laptop and stubbed out her cigarette forcefully. "We need help. I'm calling Saif."

Later that evening, Neha's friend Saif joined them via video call. He was a wiry man with sharp features, his room cluttered with monitors and wires.  

"You're saying they're using scanner data?" Saif asked, his fingers flying over his keyboard.  

"Exactly," Neha said. "Can you trace where it's being stored or accessed?"  

Saif nodded. "Send me the document."  

Zuree hesitated. "Can he be trusted?"  

Neha gave her a reassuring look. "Saif's solid. He doesn't ask questions, and he doesn't betray trust."  

They sent the file, and within minutes, Saif's face darkened. "This data isn't stored on a regular server. It's bouncing between several encrypted nodes. Whoever's behind this is covering their tracks."  

"What about the source?" Neha pressed.  

Saif adjusted his glasses. "There's one IP that stands out. It's tied to a private research lab. And... get this... it's affiliated with your university."  

Zuree's stomach dropped. "Dr. Mark."  

As Saif worked, Neha's phone buzzed with another message. This one read:  

*"You're out of your depth. Walk away, or you'll regret it."*  

Neha smirked, holding the phone up for Zuree to see. "They're trying hard to scare us."  

But Zuree wasn't amused. Her own phone buzzed with a notification... a video link. Against Neha's advice, she clicked it.  

Her screen filled with a live feed of her parents' home. The camera panned across the living room, lingering on family photos.  

"No," Zuree whispered, her hands flying to her mouth.  

Neha grabbed the phone. "They're crossing a line."  

Zuree was trembling. "What do we do? They know where my family lives!"  

Neha's eyes narrowed. "We fight smarter. If they're watching your family, we'll use that to bait them."  

Zuree looked at her in disbelief. "What are you saying?"  

"We're going to make them think they've won," Neha said, her voice steely. "We'll set a trap of our own."  

Neha and Saif worked late into the night, formulating a plan. They decided to use Saif's tech skills to plant false data, making it seem like Zuree was ready to give up.  

"You'll send them a message," Saif explained, "saying you're ready to comply. We'll monitor their response and trace their location."  

Zuree was hesitant but nodded. "What if they see through it?"  

"They won't," Neha assured her. "These people thrive on fear and control. They'll take the bait."  

As the night wore on, Zuree felt the weight of the situation pressing down on her. The stakes were higher than ever, but with Neha by her side, she clung to a fragile hope.  

For the first time, they weren't just running... they were fighting back.
