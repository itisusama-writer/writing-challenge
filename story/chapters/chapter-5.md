# The Meeting

### Scene 1: **The Unexpected Meeting**  
- **Setting**: Zuree is leaving a class or walking through campus, distracted by her thoughts, when Dr. Mark approaches her.  
- **Dialogue Snippet**:  
  - **Dr. Mark**: "Zuree, a moment of your time, if you don’t mind?"  
  - **Zuree** (hesitant): "Of course... Is something wrong?"  
  - **Dr. Mark** (calm, yet unsettling): "Not wrong, per se. I noticed you seemed... troubled at the charity event. That scanner can be intimidating to some."  
  - **Zuree** (nervously): "I wouldn’t say intimidating... Just new technology, right?"  
  - **Dr. Mark** (leaning slightly closer): "New technology always comes with... possibilities. You’d be surprised what it can uncover."

### Scene 2: **Dr. Mark’s Cryptic Remarks**  
- **Setting**: They find themselves in a quieter corridor or an empty lecture hall.  
- **Dialogue Snippet**:  
  - **Dr. Mark**: "I’ve always been fascinated by how much a single piece of data can reveal about someone. A handprint, for instance—it tells a story. Sometimes one we don’t even know we’re sharing."  
  - **Zuree** (defensive): "Why are you telling me this? Is there a problem with the data from the event?"  
  - **Dr. Mark** (smiling faintly): "Oh, no problem. Just... observations. Let’s just say some patterns stand out more than others."  
  - **Zuree** (voice shaking): "Patterns? What are you talking about?"  
  - **Dr. Mark** (pausing deliberately): "Relax, Zuree. I’m just saying it’s fascinating. You’re an interesting subject... academically, of course."

### Scene 3: **The Warning**  
- **Setting**: As Zuree prepares to leave, Dr. Mark gives her a parting remark that lingers in her mind.  
- **Dialogue Snippet**:  
  - **Dr. Mark**: "Sometimes, the things we want to hide are the very things that make us vulnerable. Be careful who you trust. Technology has a way of making secrets... public."  
  - **Zuree** (frozen): "What are you trying to say?"  
  - **Dr. Mark** (with a knowing smile): "Just a piece of advice. Take it or leave it."

### Scene 4: **Emotional Breakdown**

- **Internal Monologue/Thoughts**:  
  - *“How does he know? Was that a threat? Does he have something to do with this?”*  
  - *“Why did I let him get to me? What am I supposed to do now?”*  

- She checks her phone obsessively, expecting another coded message, but nothing comes. This only heightens her paranoia.

- **Thought Snippet**:  
  - *“Patterns... vulnerable... secrets becoming public... He knows something. He has to.”*  
  - *“But why would he approach me like that? Was he warning me? Or... taunting me?”*  
3. **Cliffhanger**: As she calms down slightly, Zuree receives a message from a new coded sender:  
   - *“He’s watching you. Be careful.”*
