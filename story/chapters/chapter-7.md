# A Midnight Encounter

The clock on the wall blinked 1:37 AM as Zuree padded silently into the common kitchen, the faint glow of her phone lighting the way. Her mind was a whirlwind, the recent scandal leaving her sleepless and on edge. She ran her fingers through her hair, gripping the edges of the counter as she tried to steady her breathing.  

The faint clink of a spoon startled her. Zuree's head snapped up, her heart pounding.  

"Sorry!" came a soft voice. "I didn't mean to scare you."  

Zuree turned to see a girl standing near the microwave, a steaming mug of black coffee in her hands. She was wearing pajama pants and a loose hoodie, her dark hair tied in a messy bun.  

"It's okay," Zuree mumbled, forcing a small, polite smile. She moved toward the sink to pour herself a glass of water, hoping the conversation would end there.  

"You're up late," the girl said, her tone gentle but curious. "Couldn't sleep?"  

Zuree hesitated, then nodded. "Something like that."  

The girl gave a small chuckle. "Same here. First night in a new place... it always takes me a while to adjust."  

Zuree turned slightly, surprised. "You're new?"  

"Yeah, just moved in today... Neha Harun," the girl said, smiling as she extended a hand.  

Zuree hesitated, then shook it. "Zureenab Nasir."  

Neha gestured toward the mug in her hand. "Want some black coffee? It helps sometimes... or at least, that's what my my husband once said."  

Zuree blinked, caught off guard by the simple kindness. "Uh, sure. Thanks."  

As Neha poured her a mug, Zuree leaned against the counter. "How are you finding the hostel so far?"  

"It's... different," Neha admitted, handing her the mug. "But I like the quiet at night. Feels like I can think clearly."  

Zuree gave a small nod, taking a sip. For a moment, they stood in silence, the hum of the refrigerator the only sound between them.  

"So, what about you?" Neha asked cautiously. "You okay?"  

Zuree's grip on the mug tightened. "I... It's been a tough day."  

Neha tilted her head slightly, her expression empathetic but not probing. "If you ever want to talk, I'm here. I'm a good listener."  

Zuree looked at her, surprised by the sincerity in her voice. She opened her mouth to respond but closed it again, unsure of what to say.  

"Anyway," Neha said, sensing Zuree's hesitation, "I'll let you have some peace. But really, I'm just upstairs if you need anything."  

As Neha left, Zuree watched her go, the warmth of the black coffee in her hands contrasting with the cold knot of fear in her chest. For the first time in days, she felt a faint glimmer of relief... Maybe she didn't have to face everything alone.
