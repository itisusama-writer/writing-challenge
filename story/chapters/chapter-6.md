# The Consequences

The morning light filtered through the blinds as Zuree dragged herself out of bed. The cryptic message still glowed in her mind like a flashing alarm. She dressed hastily, her heart heavy, and decided there was no other option. She needed help... official help.  

At the police station, Zuree explained her situation to the officer behind the desk. "There's someone... following me. They're using technology to..."  

Before she could finish, the officer's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and his face paled. A message from **SB-SS-UHB8SQV** had appeared.  

*"Officer Karim, 2018. That night. Do you want it leaked?"*  

Karim's jaw tightened, his hand lingering on the phone as if debating whether to throw it across the room or bury it in his pocket. His mind raced. *How do they know about this? After all these years?* He swallowed hard, his fingers clenching the edge of the desk.  

He forced a deep breath and looked up at Zuree. "You're saying someone is stalking you? Using technology how?"  

Zuree hesitated. "I don't know exactly. They're sending messages, cryptic ones. And now it feels like..." She trailed off, searching for words. "Like they're everywhere. Watching everything I do."  

Karim leaned back in his chair, feigning thoughtfulness while panic surged through him. "Do you have these messages? Anything concrete?"  

Zuree fumbled with her phone, pulling up screenshots of the warnings. She held it out to him. He glanced at the screen briefly but didn't touch the device. "Hmm. It could be spam," he said dismissively.  

"Spam?" Zuree's voice rose. "This isn't random. It's targeted! Someone's trying to ruin me, and I think they're connected to the campus."  

Karim tapped his pen against the desk, avoiding her eyes. His mind was elsewhere, back to 2018, to the mistake that had haunted him in private but never surfaced. Until now.  

"We'll look into it," he finally said, his tone clipped and distant.  

Zuree's frustration boiled over. "That's it? That's all you're going to do?"  

"Miss," Karim said firmly, "these things take time. You'll have to be patient."  

"But what if..."  

"Patience," he repeated, cutting her off, his tone turning cold. "We'll be in touch."  

Zuree stood frozen for a moment, the dismissal sinking in. With a tight nod, she turned and walked out of the station, her stomach sinking further with every step. Behind her, Karim slumped in his chair, the weight of his secret bearing down harder than ever.  

Returning to campus, Zuree tried to steady herself. *"Maybe they'll actually investigate... Maybe I'll hear back soon."* But as she crossed the quad, whispers followed her.  

Her phone buzzed with notification after notification. She hesitated before opening one. Her breath caught in her throat.  

A photo... one from years ago, one she had never wanted to see again... was spreading across campus social media. The image was out of context, doctored just enough to implicate her in something sordid.  

The whispers turned into outright laughter and murmured insults as students passed her. The weight of their judgment pressed down on her like a physical force.  

Tears burned at the corners of her eyes, but she refused to let them fall. *"This can't be happening."*  

The hallways were deserted as Zuree stormed into Dr. Mark's office, the door slamming against the wall. She didn't bother knocking.  

Dr. Mark looked up from his desk, his expression calm but with a glint of something darker in his eyes. "Zuree," he said evenly, his voice almost welcoming. "To what do I owe this... passionate entrance?"  

"You know what this is about," she snapped, her voice trembling with anger and desperation. "You did this, didn't you? The photos, the messages... everything. You're trying to ruin me!"  

Dr. Mark's lips twitched into a faint smile as he closed the folder on his desk with deliberate slowness. "Careful," he said, his tone soft but sharp, like a scalpel cutting through her resolve. "Throwing around accusations can be dangerous... especially for someone like you."  

Zuree's fists clenched at her sides. "I won't let you destroy my life. Whatever game you're playing, I'm not your pawn."

He leaned back in his chair, studying her with an air of amusement. "Pawn? Oh, Zuree, you're giving yourself too little credit. You're much more important than that."  

Her heart pounded. "What are you talking about?"  

Dr. Mark stood slowly, his imposing frame casting a long shadow that seemed to swallow the room. He moved to the window, looking out over the campus with an air of detachment. "You know," he began, "the funny thing about secrets is how easily they unravel when you pull the right thread. One handprint. One scan. One careless mistake at a charity event... and suddenly, a tapestry of truths unfolds."  

Zuree's breath caught in her throat. "What... what are you saying?"  

He turned to face her, his smile now fully predatory. "I'm saying that by the end of the week, everyone will know what you've been hiding. Your spotless reputation? Consider it history. That internship you're hoping for? Gone. Your friends? Well, they'll see you in a whole new light."  

Her knees felt weak, but she refused to let him see her falter. "You can't do this."  

"I'm not doing anything," he said with a mock... innocent shrug. "You did it to yourself. I'm just making sure the truth gets the audience it deserves."  

The room spun as his words sank in. Zuree tried to speak, but her throat tightened, leaving her voiceless.  

Dr. Mark moved closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "You came here looking for answers, Zuree. Now you have them. The question is... what are you going to do about it?"  

Dr. Mark stepped past her, his presence lingering in the room like a stormcloud.
