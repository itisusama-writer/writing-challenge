# Introduction

The sunlight streamed through the cream-colored curtains of Zuree's hostel room, the faint hum of campus life filtering through her slightly cracked window. The muted buzz of early morning chatter mixed with the occasional bicycle bell echoed in the courtyard below. Zuree sat up, her hands instinctively brushing through her disheveled hair. The desk by her bed was a chaotic tableau: stacks of books, mismatched coffee mugs, and her ever-glowing ring light. a silent testament to the duality of her existence.  

She grabbed her phone from the nightstand. Notifications flooded the screen: likes, comments, and shares. One in particular caught her eye, a comment on her latest reel that read, *"Your life is like a movie! So inspiring!"* A smirk curled her lips. They didn't know, of course, that the "movie" was scripted.  

Her thumb hovered over the notification bar as a pang of unease rippled through her chest. She dismissed the feeling with a practiced shrug and slid out of bed.  

Zuree rushed down the hostel hallway, her steps quick yet calculated. Her sleek black backpack bobbed behind her as she narrowly avoided a groggy student dragging their feet toward the showers.  

"Hey, Zuree!" a voice called out.  

She turned to see a cluster of her friends leaning against the stairwell railing.  

"Look at this," Alisha teased, holding up her phone. On the screen was Zuree's latest post, racking up views faster than a wildfire.  

"Already viral before breakfast?" Eshaal chimed in with a grin.  

"Must be nice to live in your world," someone muttered, half-joking.  

Zuree laughed, brushing off the comment. "You guys know me... same old Zuree, just with a little sparkle."

Inside, the weight of their expectations pressed against her chest. She quickened her pace, eager to escape their critical observations.  

Escaping from ther prying eyes Zuree walked in her element debating in a marketing lecture. She started the debate righ aways exchanging sharp insights with classmates. Her ambition and determination are evident.

Her day was not over yet, there were so many many classes she had to go through and between her classes, she mostly slips away for a moment to film a quick reel with her friends, masking exhaustion with a radiant smile.    

Zuree's classes were over but her friends had to take few more extra classes, as though she decided to step in the library to wait for them, or to film some more solo content.

The library was dimly lit, its usual buzz replaced with a calm stillness. Zuree sat by a corner window, flipping through the pages of a marketing textbook. Her pen twirled absently between her fingers, but her thoughts were elsewhere.  

Her phone buzzed, breaking the silence. A text from her mother popped up: *‚ÄúWhat are you planning after graduation? We need to talk soon.‚Äù*  

Zuree stared at the screen, her jaw tightening. Her chest swelled with the familiar frustration she had long learned to bury. The question wasn‚Äôt new, nor was her aversion to answering it. She tossed the phone aside and leaned back in her chair, staring out at the sprawling campus lawn.  

A few moments later, her hand reached for her phone again, this time opening her camera app. With the window as a backdrop, she tilted her head slightly, letting a soft smile play on her lips. She snapped a picture and posted it with a caption: *‚ÄúStudy grind never stops üí™‚ú®.‚Äù*  

In the evening she sits in the hostel lounge. She shares light-hearted banter with her close curated circle of friends Eshaal Ahmad, Alisha Hameed and Aiman Afaq which she choose with care, and for her own benifits in futere. Aiman joke about how Zuree's life is ‚Äútoo perfect‚Äù to be real.
  
Zuree deflects with a laugh, but her inner dialogue reveals cracks in the facade... a fear of losing control over the life and reputation she's built.

The hostel grew quiet as the night deepened. Zuree sat on the narrow ledge of her window, her knees pulled up to her chest. The city lights flickered in the distance, a mosaic of moving cars and streetlights.  

She exhaled slowly, her breath fogging up the glass. Her reflection stared back at her, and for a fleeting second, she caught a glimpse of herself, untouched by filters, stripped of the masks she so carefully wore.  

Her thoughts swirled, the threads of her life tangled in a web she wasn‚Äôt sure she could maintain much longer. The charity event loomed ahead, an innocuous gathering that she thought would be just another stepping stone.  

But something about the quiet stillness of this night whispered otherwise.  

# The Charity Event

It was the second week of Ramzan in LUMS, all the hussel and bussel all around the campus. Students were running to their classes, some chatting about a upcomming event. Some taking pictures of the a new innovation of Dr. Mark, the machine learning professor.

I noticed it through posters on campus and social media announcements from the LUMS student council. 
Zuree and her friends noticed a poster and a scanner on a table, covered with a glass box with the lable *Biometric Data Scanner*. And on the poster was written the upcomming charity event with the new innovation.

The buzz really began when people started talking about the handprint scanner. A totally unique idea that grabbed everyone's attention.

Zuree woke up early that day, feeling unusually excited for the event. The sunlight was streaming through through her hostel room curtains, she could hear the morning chatter outside of her window. After quickly getting ready, She grabbed her sleek black backpack and met Alisha and Eshaal in the hostel common room.

"I am exited for the event." Elisha said.

"Yaa. It seems amazing to be the part of a good cause." Zuree said, staring at the student walking out of the hostel for the event.

"Guys. We are getting late. The event had started." Alisha said, standing in front of them.

They walked to the event together, laughing and talking about how everyone was hyped for the handprint scanner. 

"Why are people so crazy for a scanner... Stupid people." Alisha whispered.

The energy on campus was electric, and the decorations, fairy lights and banners... made it feel festive despite the heat.

At the event, Zuree's eyes were all over the place. Initially, she felt proud and excited to be part of something so innovative. The idea of contributing to charity with this cool tech made her feel like she was part of something futuristic. But deep down, there was this faint unease that she couldn't shake... like a shadow lurking just out of sight.

The students were buzzing with curiosity and excitement.

"Did you see how it scans your hand? It's like something out of a sci-fi movie!" one guy exclaimed to his friends.

"Do you think our data is really safe, though?" Alisha whispered to her Eshaal, glancing toward the scanners.

"Tahir Khadim's behind this tech, right? He's supposed to be a genius." another student remarked, clearly impressed, and got replied by his frined, "No. The main idea for this was Dr. Mark's.". Their debate goes on for a moment.

Eshaal leaned over to Zuree at one point and teased, "Zuree, this is so your thing... next-level glamour for charity!" She laughed it off, but inside, Zuree couldn't help wondering if she was as confident as she appeared.

It was now Zuree's turn to scan the hand, she stepped forward, feeling a mix of anticipation and curiosity. The scanner was sleek, a shiny black device with soft blue lights glowing around its edges.

She placed her hand on the scanner. The surface was cool to the touch, and as soon as her palm made contact, the device emitted a faint hum. A soft light passed over my hand, and she noticed tiny details on the screen lines forming a map of her palm.

*Zureenab Nasir... Age 23* her details were mentioned below the map of her palm.

For a split second, she hesitated. It felt... too precise, almost intrusive. But she brushed the thought aside and smiled, thinking about how this was just part of the process.

As the scan completed, Tahir Khadim, who was nearby, gave her an approving nod. "All set," he said with a slight smile, but there was something about his expression, calm, almost too calm that stuck with her.

Zuree stepped away, feeling a strange mix of pride for contributing and a faint ripple of unease she couldn't quite name.

---

The charity event was the perfect cover. On the surface, it appeared to be a noble cause. A way to bring the campus together during Ramzan while showcasing groundbreaking technology. But for Tahir Khadim and Dr. Mark, it was much more than that.

The biometric data scanner wasn't just about tracking donations; it was a critical phase of a larger plan. Every handprint, every bio-signature collected, was a piece of data, valuable, unique, and deeply personal. While the students marveled at the innovation and felt pride in their contributions, they unknowingly handed over the very essence of their identity.

Thair oversaw the process carefully, ensuring the data was seamlessly logged into their secure database. His partner, Dr. Mark, designed the core algorithms, but it was his meticulous handling of the event logistics that made this operation flawless.

Tahir watched the students with a calm demeanor, offering polite smiles and reassuring words. Inside, he felt a quiet satisfaction. Each scan brought them closer to achieving what they had envisioned. A system that no one could escape.

A young black haired girl caught Tahir's attention that day. Her hesitation during the scan, the way she glanced at the screen. Something about her made him curious. He nodded at her when her scan completed, masking his thoughts behind a neutral expression. She had no idea what she had just given away. None of them did.

---

Their was a moment when a strange error briefly appeared on the screen during the scanning process. It was a flicker of red text... a string of numbers and symbols that shouldn't have been there. Most people wouldn't have noticed, but Tahir did. It was unexpected, and for a moment, he felt a flicker of unease.

The hurried conversation with Dr. Mark happened right after. Tahir pulled him aside, away from the students, and whispered, "There's an anomaly in the system. Some of the scans are returning inconsistent data... something with the algorithms."

Dr. Mark frowned but remained composed. "It's nothing critical," he said, his voice low but firm. "We'll clean it up in post-processing. The data we need is intact. Don't draw attention to it."

Tahir nodded, but Dr. Mark's tone didn't sit well with him. It wasn't reassurance... it was a command. Even Tahir wasn't aware to every layer of Dr. Mark's plan, and that realization made him wonder just how deep this project really went.

# It Started

When Zuree woke up the next morning after the charity event, everything felt heavy for her. The sunlight spilling into her room didn't bring the usual warmth as everyday; instead, it felt like an unwelcome spotlight. She groggily reached for her phone, as she usually do, to scroll through the morning buzz.

That's when she saw it. A post was going viral. At first, Zuree didn't understand what she was looking at, then it hit her like a slap. It was an inappropriate picture of her with her ex-boyfriend. Her heart sank, stomach churned, and and couldn't breathe for a moment.

Zuree sat there, staring at the screen, hoping it wasn't real. Hoping it was some sort of nightmare. But it wasn't. It felt like her throat tighten as panic set in. 

"How could this happen? Who would do this to me?" Zuree's mind raced with questions.

She decided to call Alisha and Eshaal. They were as shocked as Zuree was. Alisha, being the blunt one, immediately asked, "Who could even have this picture, Zuree? Did you ever share it with anyone?" Her tone wasn't accusatory, but it stung.

Eshaal, on the other hand, was softer. "Zuree, this is horrible. We'll figure this out, okay? You're not alone in this," she said, but even her words couldn't calm the storm inside her.

As for personal attacks... There were a few. Zuree's phone buzzed with messages from numbers she didn't recognize, and some of them were awful. People saying things like, "Guess the charity event wasn't your only headline," or making cruel jokes about the photo. She didn't reply to any of them.

Even on social media, there were comments under the post. Some were from strangers, others from people on campus. A few defended her, saying the picture could've been faked or hacked, but most were just gossip or judgment.

It felt like her whole world had turned against her overnight, and no matter how hard she tried to think of who could do this, she couldn't come up with a name.

It wasn't just the photo. Zuree thought it might stop there, but it didn't. A few days later, when things started calming down... or at least she thought they were. 

Zuree got a message.  

It wasn't from a normal sender; the ID was a weird, coded string: **SB-FF-KOP63NN5.** At first, she thought it might be spam, but the message wasn't random. It was personal. It said:  

*"You want this to stop? Then you'll listen carefully. Don't make me show more.*"  

My hands started shaking as she read it. 

"More? More what? What else could they have?" The thought of more secrets being out there, of her life being even more exposed, made her heart race.  

Then another message came through, this time from **SB-FF-OSH2QHA2.** It said something similar, like a warning. She didn't reply. She didn't know what to do.  

After that, the messages kept coming. Each one was from a different sender code, **SB-FF-HAA4NRTU**, **TH-SM-RBTTH96POX**, and others. But they all had the same tone, the same pressure. It felt like whoever was behind this wanted her to feel trapped, to have no way out.  

They didn't demand anything specific right away, but the threat was clear. If Zuree didn't cooperate... or if she tried to figure out who they were, they'd leak more.

It all made her feel completely powerless. More than the photo, more than the messages, it was the feeling of someone pulling strings behind the scenes... someone who knew things about her, things she never wanted the world to see. That was the worst part.

Zuree cried a lot. There were moments when she felt like she couldn't breathe, like the walls of her room were closing in on her. She cried until her head hurt, until her chest ached, and even then, it didn't feel like enough to let it all out.

But it wasn't just sadness. it was anger too. Anger at whoever was doing this, at herself for not knowing how to fight back, and at the situation for even existing. It felt like no matter what she did, she was stuck in this invisible trap.

There were moments when she'd tell herself to stop crying, to get up and figure it out. But as soon as she'd try, another message would come, or she'd remember the photo, or worse, she'd imagine what they might do next, and it would all come crashing down again.

# Supposed Solution

After receiving the blackmail messages, It feel like she's trapped in a nightmare that she can't wake up from. It's this suffocating mix of fear, confusion, and anger. Every time she see one of those coded senders pop up on her phone, her stomach drops, and her heart races.  

Zuree feels like exposed, like someone has stripped away all her defenses and is watching her every move. It's not just about the messages anymore. It's about the power they hold over her. They know things about her that she thought were hers to keep, and now it was like they can twist those things against her whenever they want.  

She spent hours going over the messages, trying to find a pattern or a clue. Every time Zuree think she spotted something, it just leads to more questions. Desperate for answers but terrified of what she might find.  

Crying has become a routine for her, but it doesn't help. It's like she was carrying this invisible weight that no one else can see, and it's pulling her down further every day. She can't trust anyone fully... not even Alisha and Eshaal. What if the person doing this is someone close?  

And yet, there's a small, stubborn part of her that doesn't want to let them win. It's buried under all the fear, but it's there, whispering that *Zuree you need to fight back*. She just don't know how yet.

Zuree racked her brain, trying to figure out who could be behind this, but no one stands out clearly. That's part of what makes this so terrifying.

At first, Zuree wondered if it could be her ex. He's the only person who would have had that photo, and they didn't exactly end on good terms. But... he's not the type to pull something like this. At least, Zuree don't think he is. And if he was involved, why would he be hiding behind these weird coded messages?

Then She thought about someone from campus, maybe someone she don't know well. But how would they get access to that photo? Unless it's someone who's been watching her for a while. Someone who somehow hacked into her phone or her data. The thought makes her skin crawl.

Dr. Mark and Tahir Khadim also cross her mind. The timing with the charity event and the biometric scanner feels too coincidental. But what motive would they have? They seem so focused on their tech; She can't imagine them stooping to this. Still, that faint unease Zuree felt during the scan...  it hasn't gone away.

Right now, it feels like everyone is a suspect, and that's the scariest part. Whoever is doing this knows her. Knows things they shouldn't, and she don't even know where to start looking for them.

---

It's all about the betrayal. The exposure is humiliating, and the consequences are terrifying, but knowing someone violated Zuree's trust... that they had access to parts of her, that she thought were safe, is what truly keeps her up at night. That photo was something private, something she never thought anyone would weaponize. It's like a knife in her back, and the worst part is she din't even know who's holding it.

She can't shake the feeling charity event. The timing is just too perfect.. or too awful, depending on how you look at it. The charity event was supposed to be this big, innovative thing, and then this happens right after? That biometric scanner was collecting everyone's data, and the unease she felt during the scan... it's still there. It's like her gut is screaming at her that something wasn't right. Maybe someone used that event to get to Zuree, but she can't figure out how or why.

It feels like she's piecing together a puzzle without all the pieces, and the picture she's seeing is starting to scare her.

Zuree replayed the charity event in her mind for the hundredth time, trying to recall if she noticed anything unusual. The scanner had stood out to her, not just because it was new technology, but because of the way it had made her feel. The demonstration was flawless, almost too perfect. She remembered how Tahir Khadim had explained its features to be secure, innovative, infallible. But the faint unease had started the moment her data was captured. She couldn't explain it at the time, but now it gnawed at her.

She thought back to the man who had been standing next to the scanner, the one whose face she couldn't quite place. He wasn't part of the team that had been introduced. He wasn't mingling like the other guests either. Had he been watching her? Or was her paranoia twisting every memory into something sinister?

The messages were no less haunting. Zuree had gone through them so many times she could recite them word for word. The sender IDs were random strings of numbers and letters, almost like they were generated by a machine. But one thing stood out... each message had been sent at a specific time: 11:11 PM. She hadn't noticed it at first, too caught up in the horror of their content, but now it seemed deliberate. Was it a signature? A taunt? 

The messages also referenced details that no one else should know. Private moments, conversations, and feelings Zuree hadn't shared with anyone. It made her feel exposed, like every corner of her life was under a microscope. But when she tried to piece together how they could know these things, she hit a wall. Her phone? Her laptop? Something in her home? The possibilities were endless, and each one was more terrifying than the last.

Seeking help crossed her mind, but trust was a luxury she couldn't afford. Alisha and Eshaal were her closest friends, and she wanted to believe in them, but doubt had crept in. If the person behind this was someone close, confiding in them could make things worse. Besides, what could they do? This was bigger than them, bigger than her. 

She had considered going to the authorities, but what would she even say? That someone was sending her cryptic messages and she had no idea who or why? She didn't have proof, just a gut feeling that this was more than it seemed. Without tangible evidence, she feared they'd dismiss her as paranoid.

And yet, that stubborn part of her... the part that refused to let this person win was growing louder. If she couldn't trust anyone, she'd figure this out herself. Zuree decided to start small, revisiting the charity event. She'd look into the attendees, cross-reference them with the times and dates of the messages. She'd scour every photo, every video from that night, searching for something... anything... that felt out of place.

She also decided to inspect her devices. Maybe there was a clue there, a piece of spyware or a strange log entry she'd overlooked. It wasn't much, but it was a start. The thought of taking action, however small, gave her a flicker of hope. 

For the first time in weeks, Zuree felt a shift. The fear was still there, sharp and suffocating, but so was the fight. Whoever was doing this thought they could control her, that they could trap her in their game. But Zuree wasn't going to play by their rules anymore.

# The Meeting  

Zuree strode briskly between lecture halls. Her mind was a tangle of thoughts, the cacophony of her recent experiences pressing against her temples. She barely noticed when Dr. Mark stepped into her path until his voice cut through her haze.  

"Zuree, a moment of your time, if you don't mind?"  

Startled, she stopped and turned, forcing a polite, fake smile. "Of course... Is something wrong?"  

Dr. Mark's calm demeanor was oddly unsettling. He adjusted the strap of his leather bag and tilted his head slightly. "Not wrong, per se. I noticed you seemed... troubled at the charity event. That scanner can be intimidating to some."  

Zuree stiffened, the air around her suddenly heavier. "I wouldn't say intimidating... Just new technology, right?"  

Dr. Mark leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "New technology always comes with... possibilities. You'd be surprised what it can uncover."  

They found themselves in an empty lecture hall, the dim lighting and echo of their footsteps amplifying the tension. Dr. Mark took a seat on the edge of a desk, casually folding his arms. Zuree remained standing, her hands clasped tightly.  

"I've always been fascinated," Dr. Mark began, "by how much a single piece of data can reveal about someone. A handprint, for instance... it tells a story. Sometimes one we don't even know we're sharing."  

"Why are you telling me this?" Zuree's voice was sharper now, defensive. "Is there a problem with the data from the event?"  

"Oh, no problem," he replied with a faint smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Just... observations. Let's just say some patterns stand out more than others."  

Zuree's heart raced. "Patterns? What are you talking about?"  

Dr. Mark let the silence stretch, his gaze steady on her. "Relax, Zuree. I'm just saying it's fascinating. You're an interesting subject... academically, of course."  

The conversation left Zuree itching to leave, but as she turned to go, Dr. Mark's voice halted her.  

"Sometimes, the things we want to hide are the very things that make us vulnerable," he said, his tone soft but weighted. "Be careful who you trust. Technology has a way of making secrets... public."  

She froze in her tracks. "What are you trying to say?"  

Dr. Mark's faint smile returned, this time with a hint of something darker. "Just a piece of advice. Take it or leave it."  

---

Back in her room, Zuree locked the door and slumped against it, her legs giving way. The tears came before she could stop them, a torrent of fear and frustration spilling over.  

*"How does he know? Was that a threat? Does he have something to do with this?"*  

Her thoughts spiraled, each question more suffocating than the last. She threw herself onto her bed, gripping her pillow as if it could anchor her to reality.  

*"Why did I let him get to me? What am I supposed to do now?"*  

Her phone buzzed on the bedside table, and she lunged for it, half-expecting another coded message. But the screen was blank, save for the usual notifications. The silence was unbearable.  

Hours later, Zuree sat cross-legged on the floor, staring into space as she replayed the conversation in her mind.  

*"Patterns... vulnerable... secrets becoming public... He knows something. He has to."*  

Her breathing slowed as the pieces refused to fit together.  

*"But why would he approach me like that? Was he warning me? Or... taunting me?"*  

Her phone vibrated in her hand, breaking her reverie. A message flashed across the screen from an **SB-LS-YTG6CWWY**:  

*"He's watching you. Be careful."*  

Zuree's breath hitched, the weight of the warning pressing down on her chest. She looked toward the window, the creeping darkness outside a reflection of the storm brewing within.  

# The Consequences

The morning light filtered through the blinds as Zuree dragged herself out of bed. The cryptic message still glowed in her mind like a flashing alarm. She dressed hastily, her heart heavy, and decided there was no other option. She needed help... official help.  

At the police station, Zuree explained her situation to the officer behind the desk. "There's someone... following me. They're using technology to..."  

Before she could finish, the officer's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and his face paled. A message from **SB-SS-UHB8SQV** had appeared.  

*"Officer Karim, 2018. That night. Do you want it leaked?"*  

Karim's jaw tightened, his hand lingering on the phone as if debating whether to throw it across the room or bury it in his pocket. His mind raced. *How do they know about this? After all these years?* He swallowed hard, his fingers clenching the edge of the desk.  

He forced a deep breath and looked up at Zuree. "You're saying someone is stalking you? Using technology how?"  

Zuree hesitated. "I don't know exactly. They're sending messages, cryptic ones. And now it feels like..." She trailed off, searching for words. "Like they're everywhere. Watching everything I do."  

Karim leaned back in his chair, feigning thoughtfulness while panic surged through him. "Do you have these messages? Anything concrete?"  

Zuree fumbled with her phone, pulling up screenshots of the warnings. She held it out to him. He glanced at the screen briefly but didn't touch the device. "Hmm. It could be spam," he said dismissively.  

"Spam?" Zuree's voice rose. "This isn't random. It's targeted! Someone's trying to ruin me, and I think they're connected to the campus."  

Karim tapped his pen against the desk, avoiding her eyes. His mind was elsewhere, back to 2018, to the mistake that had haunted him in private but never surfaced. Until now.  

"We'll look into it," he finally said, his tone clipped and distant.  

Zuree's frustration boiled over. "That's it? That's all you're going to do?"  

"Miss," Karim said firmly, "these things take time. You'll have to be patient."  

"But what if..."  

"Patience," he repeated, cutting her off, his tone turning cold. "We'll be in touch."  

Zuree stood frozen for a moment, the dismissal sinking in. With a tight nod, she turned and walked out of the station, her stomach sinking further with every step. Behind her, Karim slumped in his chair, the weight of his secret bearing down harder than ever.  

Returning to campus, Zuree tried to steady herself. *"Maybe they'll actually investigate... Maybe I'll hear back soon."* But as she crossed the quad, whispers followed her.  

Her phone buzzed with notification after notification. She hesitated before opening one. Her breath caught in her throat.  

A photo... one from years ago, one she had never wanted to see again... was spreading across campus social media. The image was out of context, doctored just enough to implicate her in something sordid.  

The whispers turned into outright laughter and murmured insults as students passed her. The weight of their judgment pressed down on her like a physical force.  

Tears burned at the corners of her eyes, but she refused to let them fall. *"This can't be happening."*  

The hallways were deserted as Zuree stormed into Dr. Mark's office, the door slamming against the wall. She didn't bother knocking.  

Dr. Mark looked up from his desk, his expression calm but with a glint of something darker in his eyes. "Zuree," he said evenly, his voice almost welcoming. "To what do I owe this... passionate entrance?"  

"You know what this is about," she snapped, her voice trembling with anger and desperation. "You did this, didn't you? The photos, the messages... everything. You're trying to ruin me!"  

Dr. Mark's lips twitched into a faint smile as he closed the folder on his desk with deliberate slowness. "Careful," he said, his tone soft but sharp, like a scalpel cutting through her resolve. "Throwing around accusations can be dangerous... especially for someone like you."  

Zuree's fists clenched at her sides. "I won't let you destroy my life. Whatever game you're playing, I'm not your pawn."

He leaned back in his chair, studying her with an air of amusement. "Pawn? Oh, Zuree, you're giving yourself too little credit. You're much more important than that."  

Her heart pounded. "What are you talking about?"  

Dr. Mark stood slowly, his imposing frame casting a long shadow that seemed to swallow the room. He moved to the window, looking out over the campus with an air of detachment. "You know," he began, "the funny thing about secrets is how easily they unravel when you pull the right thread. One handprint. One scan. One careless mistake at a charity event... and suddenly, a tapestry of truths unfolds."  

Zuree's breath caught in her throat. "What... what are you saying?"  

He turned to face her, his smile now fully predatory. "I'm saying that by the end of the week, everyone will know what you've been hiding. Your spotless reputation? Consider it history. That internship you're hoping for? Gone. Your friends? Well, they'll see you in a whole new light."  

Her knees felt weak, but she refused to let him see her falter. "You can't do this."  

"I'm not doing anything," he said with a mock... innocent shrug. "You did it to yourself. I'm just making sure the truth gets the audience it deserves."  

The room spun as his words sank in. Zuree tried to speak, but her throat tightened, leaving her voiceless.  

Dr. Mark moved closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "You came here looking for answers, Zuree. Now you have them. The question is... what are you going to do about it?"  

Dr. Mark stepped past her, his presence lingering in the room like a stormcloud.  

# A Midnight Encounter

The clock on the wall blinked 1:37 AM as Zuree padded silently into the common kitchen, the faint glow of her phone lighting the way. Her mind was a whirlwind, the recent scandal leaving her sleepless and on edge. She ran her fingers through her hair, gripping the edges of the counter as she tried to steady her breathing.  

The faint clink of a spoon startled her. Zuree's head snapped up, her heart pounding.  

"Sorry!" came a soft voice. "I didn't mean to scare you."  

Zuree turned to see a girl standing near the microwave, a steaming mug of black coffee in her hands. She was wearing pajama pants and a loose hoodie, her dark hair tied in a messy bun.  

"It's okay," Zuree mumbled, forcing a small, polite smile. She moved toward the sink to pour herself a glass of water, hoping the conversation would end there.  

"You're up late," the girl said, her tone gentle but curious. "Couldn't sleep?"  

Zuree hesitated, then nodded. "Something like that."  

The girl gave a small chuckle. "Same here. First night in a new place... it always takes me a while to adjust."  

Zuree turned slightly, surprised. "You're new?"  

"Yeah, just moved in today... Neha Harun," the girl said, smiling as she extended a hand.  

Zuree hesitated, then shook it. "Zureenab Nasir."  

Neha gestured toward the mug in her hand. "Want some black coffee? It helps sometimes... or at least, that's what my my husband once said."  

Zuree blinked, caught off guard by the simple kindness. "Uh, sure. Thanks."  

As Neha poured her a mug, Zuree leaned against the counter. "How are you finding the hostel so far?"  

"It's... different," Neha admitted, handing her the mug. "But I like the quiet at night. Feels like I can think clearly."  

Zuree gave a small nod, taking a sip. For a moment, they stood in silence, the hum of the refrigerator the only sound between them.  

"So, what about you?" Neha asked cautiously. "You okay?"  

Zuree's grip on the mug tightened. "I... It's been a tough day."  

Neha tilted her head slightly, her expression empathetic but not probing. "If you ever want to talk, I'm here. I'm a good listener."  

Zuree looked at her, surprised by the sincerity in her voice. She opened her mouth to respond but closed it again, unsure of what to say.  

"Anyway," Neha said, sensing Zuree's hesitation, "I'll let you have some peace. But really, I'm just upstairs if you need anything."  

As Neha left, Zuree watched her go, the warmth of the black coffee in her hands contrasting with the cold knot of fear in her chest. For the first time in days, she felt a faint glimmer of relief... Maybe she didn't have to face everything alone.
