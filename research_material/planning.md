
In 2023, a unique charity event took place at LUMS in Ramzan, unlike any seen before. Donations were meticulously tracked—not through traditional means—but using an advanced handprint scanner. Each contribution was logged directly into a secure database, capturing the donor's bio-signature through this state-of-the-art system. The entire process was overseen by none other than Tahir Khadim, the right hand and partner of Dr. MARK (who is the programming teacher in LUMS) behind the technology.  

Among the participants was Zureenab, whose involvement added a distinct significance to the event. However, the story doesn’t end with the charity.  

What no one realized at the time was that these collected handprints were not just for record-keeping. They were a vital piece of a much larger plan—a plan yet to be revealed.  

### How the System Works
1. **The Bio-Signature**: Each donor’s handprint is scanned and linked to their unique biological identity.  
2. **Live Data Recording**: Tahir's custom-designed system integrates live data with these bio-signatures, creating a dynamic and evolving database.  

What will this data be used for? What lies at the heart of Tahir Khadim’s and Dr. MARKS grand design? As the pieces come together, one thing is certain—this is only the beginning of a much larger, more intricate narrative.
