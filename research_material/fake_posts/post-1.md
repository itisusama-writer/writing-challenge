Some days, I walk through the corridors of LUMS and feel like the main characterâ€”owning my space, chasing my dreams, and unapologetically being me. But I know not everyone loves to see that. Itâ€™s funny how the loudest opinions come from people who donâ€™t even know my story. Keep watching, thoughâ€”your attention only adds to my glow. âœ¨

- Aliya Khan: Can you stop pretending youâ€™re perfect? We all know the real you isnâ€™t anything like this post.  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Aliya, why do you have to say things like that? I never meant to hurt anyone, but if my posts are bothering you, Iâ€™m really sorry. Iâ€™m just trying to live my life the best I can. I didnâ€™t ask for all this judgment. ðŸ˜”

- Hassan Raza: Main character? More like supporting actress in her own drama. Donâ€™t forget the mess you left behind during Ramadan.  

- Sana Malik: Glow? Is that what you call running from your past? Funny how people believe your curated little story.
    - Zureenab Nasir: Sana, I never wanted to be fake, and Iâ€™m sorry if it seems that way. You donâ€™t know everything thatâ€™s happened, and itâ€™s so hard to explain. Maybe Iâ€™ve been hiding things, but Iâ€™m just trying to figure things out. Please stop judging me. ðŸ˜¢

- Zainab Ahmed: Everyone talks about how "unapologetically" you are. If only they knew about your COVID escapades. Care to explain?  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Zainab, I really donâ€™t know why youâ€™re bringing up things from so long ago. Whatever happened during COVID is in the past, and honestly, itâ€™s nobodyâ€™s business anymore. Can we please move on?

- Fahad Sheikh: Owning your space? Lol, like the time you couldnâ€™t even face someone following you? Some "main character" energy.  

- Mehwish Tariq: Itâ€™s the constant need for validation for me. Keep postingâ€”you're just giving more material for people who actually know the truth.  

- Usman Ali: Chasing your dreams or running from your mistakes? Nathia Gali ring any bells?  

- Hira Noor: Unapologetically being you? Donâ€™t forget, secrets always have a way of coming out. Maybe youâ€™re not as untouchable as you think.  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Hira, I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re talking about, but Iâ€™m not running from anything. I know Iâ€™ve made mistakes, but donâ€™t make it sound like Iâ€™m some villain. I just... I wish people would stop digging into my past. Itâ€™s harder than you think. ðŸ˜ž

- Ahmed Iqbal: You act so brave here, but you know someoneâ€™s watching, donâ€™t you? Keep glowing. Weâ€™re all watching closely.  

- Nida Javed: The corridors of LUMS arenâ€™t as safe as you think. Some of us see right through the facade.  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Nida, why are you all so cruel? You think you know me, but you donâ€™t. Iâ€™m just trying to live and be happy. Why canâ€™t people just let me have some peace without constantly looking for ways to tear me down? ðŸ’”
