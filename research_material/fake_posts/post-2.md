"Sometimes I wonder why people canâ€™t just let others be. Iâ€™ve worked so hard to be where I am, and Iâ€™m proud of that. If that makes me too much for some of you, maybe you need to take a look at yourselves instead. Iâ€™ll keep shiningâ€”whether you like it or not. ðŸ’«"

- Sara Bilal: Worked hard? Lol, is that what you call conveniently forgetting what happened in Ramadan?  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Sara, why do you keep bringing that up? Iâ€™ve already said I donâ€™t want to talk about it. Iâ€™m not perfect, but Iâ€™m trying my best. Can you just let it go? ðŸ˜ž  

- Adeel Khan: "Too much"? More like trying too hard. Everyone knows what happened in Nathia Gali.  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Adeel, Iâ€™m tired of explaining myself to people who donâ€™t even want to listen. Whatever you think you know, just keep it to yourself. I donâ€™t owe anyone an explanation. ðŸ’”  

- Anam Sheikh: Proud? Should you really be? After all the things youâ€™ve done, itâ€™s honestly laughable that you think youâ€™re untouchable.  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Anam, I know Iâ€™ve made mistakes, and Iâ€™m not trying to act perfect. Why canâ€™t people let me move on? Itâ€™s exhausting. ðŸ˜¢  

- Umer Qureshi: Keep shining? Sure, as long as you donâ€™t mind us all knowing what really happened during COVID.  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Umer, I donâ€™t know why youâ€™re still talking about that. Iâ€™ve moved on from that time, and I wish everyone else would too. Itâ€™s not fair to keep dragging me back. ðŸ˜”  

- Maya Ali: You act like youâ€™re above it all, but we all remember the "incident" with your so-called best friend. Care to explain?  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Maya, whatever happened between me and them is private. Itâ€™s nobodyâ€™s business, and I donâ€™t owe anyone an explanation. Please, just stop. ðŸ’”  

- Haris Nadeem: Shining? Not with all those skeletons in your closet. People are watching, Zureenab. Just remember that.  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Haris, I donâ€™t understand why people enjoy tearing others down. Iâ€™m just trying to live my life. Why canâ€™t that be enough? ðŸ˜ž  

- Zoya Malik: LUMS must be really proud of its "main character" with such a questionable past.  
    - Zureenab Nasir: Zoya, Iâ€™m not pretending to be perfect. Iâ€™m human, and Iâ€™ve had my struggles. Why do people always focus on the worst instead of understanding? ðŸ˜¢
